# Learn Machine Learning

Master your path: To become an expert in machine learning, you first need a strong foundation in four learning area: Coding, Math, ML Theory and How to build your own ML project from start to finish. You can choose your own learning path you like!

## Overview Tensorflow

• Coding skills: ML requires coding in order to do the data management, parameter tuning, and parsing results needed to test and optimize your model.
• Math and stats: Machine Learning is a math heavy discipline, if you plan to modify ML models or build new ones from scratch, familiarity with the underlying math concepts is crucial to the process.
• ML theory: Knowing the basics of ML theory will give you a foundation to build on, and help you troubleshoot when something goes wrong.
• Build your own projects: Getting hands on experience with ML is the best way to put your knowledge to the test, so don’t be afraid to dive in early with a simple colab or tutorial to get some practice.
